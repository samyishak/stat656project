### Setting up your authentication

Create a `config.ini` file in the root directory and paste the following into it, replacing with your own API keys. This config file should be listed in the `.gitignore` so your API keys will not be tracked by Git.

```
[auth]

GLASSNODE_API_KEY = <your key>
NASDAQ_API_KEY = <your key>
FRED_API_KEY = <your key>
```
